# Ex4_pokGame
This project is about Graph theory, Pokemons and more! we wrote a code for getting graph from server, agents and pokemons and calculate the most efficiant way for every agent to the pokemons as the goal - is to capture as most pokemons as possible.

the project OOP_2021_Ex4 is an exercise in java OOP. the project dabbles in directed weighted graph and their representation in code . but the main focus of the project is, the java application of Ex4. the program is a game in which a group of "agents" are trying to catch as many " Pokémon", which all those elements are scattered on the graph we built. the aim of this project is to find an algorithm in which the agents could catch as many Pokémon as possible in a defined time frame, while making minimal movements (which are represented as calls to the games server). the project is also utilizing GUI to present the game to the user, in addition to printing the result in the command line if the user runs the application on it.
 
 ## Ex4 Structure
 the application is made of a collection of pre build libraries, which are responsible of connecting the game to it's server and uploading the users scores. in addition the the libraries also provide frameworks for many of the GUI elements the game components of agents and Pokémon objects. in addition the rest of the code is responsible for the algorithm and is the objective of the project.
